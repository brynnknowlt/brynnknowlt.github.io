### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    I thought Lab 8 Part 3 was really interesting, especially looking at it as
    a finished product. Though working through it was a bit challenging, it 
    felt really rewarding to see what that lab made us capable of in opening 
    and reading files. In particular, I liked watching the Twilight Zone and 
    Christmas animations in the terminal. I was finally able to comprehend what
    “input_file_stream.good()” meant in checking if the file being read was 
    still in the “good” state.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 Part 2 was cool, not because it was complex or flashy, but because we 
    created the type of program we use in our daily lives without ever 
    considering the work that has gone into it. A spell check program is vital
    to modern writing, so creating a program that read through a dictionary 
    and checked a word’s spelling was neat. This was also the lab where I 
    started to have a firm grasp on creating vectors and reading information 
    into them.

* Lab 10

    I enjoyed Lab 10 Part 3, because creating a gradient image was really fun.
    It was cool to get to work with MagickRGB and learn how to create an image
    using a program. I have lots of interest in art and animation, so seeing 
    how a program could create art was really interesting. I liked 
    experimenting with the colors to see what happened with the image prior 
    to turning in the lab.
